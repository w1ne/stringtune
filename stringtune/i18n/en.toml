Welcome to StringTune, the easiest-to-use online tuner. To start, allow access to the microphone. Play each string one at a time. The tuner will automatically detect the pitch of the note being played and indicate whether itâ€™s sharp or flat. Keep adjusting until the tuner points directly to the center. Here are some common tuning patterns for various string instruments:

- Guitar Standard Tuning: E - A - D - G - B - E
- Bass Guitar Standard Tuning: E - A - D - G
- Ukulele Standard Tuning: G - C - E - A
- Violin Standard Tuning: G - D - A - E
