Welcome to StringTune, the easiest-to-use online tuner. To start, allow access to the microphone. Play each string one at a time. The tuner will automatically detect the pitch of the note being played and indicate whether it’s sharp or flat. Keep adjusting until the tuner points directly to the center. Here are some common tuning patterns for various string instruments:
- 🎸 Guitar Standard Tuning: 🎵 E - A - D - G - B - E
- Bass Guitar Standard Tuning: 🎵 E - A - D - G
- Ukulele Standard Tuning: 🎵 G - C - E - A
- Violin Standard Tuning: 🎵 G - D - A - E
- Cello Standard Tuning: 🎵 C - G - D - A
- Viola Standard Tuning: 🎵 C - G - D - A
- Mandolin Standard Tuning: 🎵 G - D - A - E
- Banjo Standard Tuning (5-string): 🎵 G - D - G - B - D
